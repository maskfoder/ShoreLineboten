Ever since i was eight or nine. 
I've been standing on the shoreline 
All my life i've been waiting for something lasting
Oh this town kills you when you are young 
Oh this town it kills you when you are young.
I'm not the boy that i used to be 
This town has got the youth of me 
All the eyes turn hollow 
From the work of sorrow
You die young 
We are shadows 
Oh, we're shadows 
Just shadows in the alley
Standing on the paving
By the office building
There's so much to do 
Never time for you
You die when you're young 
We are shadows 
Oh, we're shadows 
Just shadows in the alley
I've got nothing 
Nothing to wait for 
Ooh
Where is life in this town?
